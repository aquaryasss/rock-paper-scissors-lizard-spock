# **The Big Bang Theory: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**

This is a web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," famously popularized by the TV show The Big Bang Theory. This game serves as a practical application of core web development skills, focusing heavily on DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.

Players choose one of three characters (Leonard, Howard, or Raj) to face off in a battle of wits against the formidable Sheldon Cooper.

### Features

    - Classic RPSLS Rules: "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

    - Choose Your Character: Play as Leonard, Howard, or Raj, each with their own unique in-game quotes.
